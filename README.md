# Simulation Game Engine

Welcome to **The Simulation Game Engine**, a versatile and ambitious project designed to simulate complex worlds with dynamic characters, procedural generation, and multiplayer functionality. This project is a work-in-progress, intended as both a learning journey and a foundation for future simulation games.

## Features

### Implemented Features:
- **Dynamic Camera System**
  - Multiple modes, including player tracking, free movement, and more.
- **Basic NPC AI**
  - NPCs with needs-based behavior (e.g., hunger, thirst, socializing).
- **Debugging Tools**
  - Sophisticated debugging system to track game variables in real-time.
- **Multiplayer Support**
  - Client-server architecture with socket-based communication.
- **Procedural Generation**
  - Foundation for creating dynamic, reusable levels.
- **Time System**
  - In-game day-night cycles and simulated passage of time.

### Planned Features:
- **Advanced Procedural Generation**
  - Expand room creation and background variety.
- **UI and Asset Management**
  - Develop drag-and-drop systems for intuitive design.
- **Customizable Characters**
  - Enable detailed player and NPC customization.
- **Enhanced Audio**
  - Implement robust sound design and music integration.
- **AI Pathfinding**
  - Refine NPC navigation with smoother, more reliable mechanics.
- **3D Elements**
  - Explore adding 3D capabilities to the engine.
- **Peripheral Support**
  - Add support for devices like gamepads.
